        <h1 class='red1'>Insert Cloud API, An open-sourced alternative to the InsertService.</h1>
        <h3>The Insert Cloud API Is an open-sourced, dynamic, alternative to the insert service.\n
            This API allows you to load any public / uncopylocked model into the game and is versitile in many ways.\n
            When used in conjuction with a properly configured webserver, is quite dynamic and can load models quickly\n
            and efficiently.
            <br>
            This API functions by first sending a request from a game to the webserver (which you will have to set up).\n
            That will then process the request and downloading the model.\n
            The very next thing that happens is the server sends a request to the ROBLOX API acting as if the owner has bought or\n
            'taken' the model and then sends a request back to the game allowing the game to compile and load the model.
