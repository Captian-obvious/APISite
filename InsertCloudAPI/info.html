        <h3 class='red2'>The Insert Cloud API Is an open-sourced, dynamic, alternative to the insert service.<br>
            This API allows you to load any public / uncopylocked model into the game and is versitile in many ways.<br>
            When used in conjuction with a properly configured webserver, is quite dynamic and can load models quickly<br>
            and efficiently.
            <br>
            This API functions by first sending a request from a game to the webserver (which you will have to set up).<br>
            That will then process the request and download the model.<br>
            The very next thing that happens is the server sends a request to the ROBLOX API acting as if the owner has bought or<br>
            'taken' the model and then sends a request back to the game allowing the game to compile and load the model.
